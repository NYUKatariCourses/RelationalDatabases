Week02 Exercise

1) How many patients are alive ?
SELECT count(*)
  FROM demographic,
       alivestatus
 WHERE demographic.alivestatus = alivestatus.code AND 
       alivestatus.alivestatus_annotation = "alive";

SELECT count(*)
    FROM demographic 
    JOIN alivestatus ON demographic.alivestatus=alivestatus.code 
    WHERE alivestatus.alivestatus_annotation = "alive"
    

2) What is the average survival time based on maritalstatus ?
SELECT marital_status.maritalstatus_annotation,
       avg(survivaltime) AS avg_survivaltime
  FROM marital_status 
       JOIN
       demographic ON demographic.maritalstatus = marital_status.code
 GROUP BY maritalstatus;


3) Number of patients who are married and alive

SELECT *
  FROM demographic
       JOIN
       alivestatus ON demographic.alivestatus = alivestatus.code
       JOIN
       marital_status ON demographic.maritalstatus = marital_status.code
 WHERE alivestatus.alivestatus_annotation = "alive" AND 
       marital_status.maritalstatus_annotation like "%married%";


4) Count the number of patients grouped by maritalstatus



5) Create a new entry in marital status called complicated with code 6


6) Repeat 4 . Do you see the number of patients with complicated ?
SELECT marital_status.maritalstatus_annotation,
       avg(survivaltime) AS avg_survivaltime
  FROM marital_status 
       LEFT JOIN
       demographic ON demographic.maritalstatus = marital_status.code
 GROUP BY maritalstatus;


7) Query using a view

CREATE VIEW marital_alivestatus AS
    SELECT *
      FROM demographic
           JOIN
           alivestatus ON demographic.alivestatus = alivestatus.code
           JOIN
           marital_status ON demographic.maritalstatus = marital_status.code;

SELECT count(*)
  FROM marital_alivestatus
 WHERE alivestatus_annotation = "alive" AND 
       maritalstatus_annotation LIKE "%married%";
